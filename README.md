## Key Features

- **Hybrid Forecasting Models**: Integrates **ARIMA + LSTM** and **ARIMA + Prophet** to capture both linear and non-linear patterns affecting commodity prices.
- **Real-Time Supply Chain Visualization**: Provides a dynamic overview of the supply chain, identifying bottlenecks and ensuring timely interventions.
- **AI-Powered Chatbots**: Offers an interactive way for users to query price data and gain insights.
- **Decision Support for Market Interventions**: Recommends optimal times for releasing stocks from the buffer, helping reduce market volatility.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Presents forecasts, insights, and real-time alerts for decision-makers to effectively stabilize prices.

## Objectives

- To deliver accurate price forecasts that aid agricultural stakeholders, including farmers, traders, and policymakers.
- To enhance market transparency and reduce the risks associated with price volatility.
- To provide real-time tools and insights that facilitate timely interventions in the market.

## Project Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data, market intelligence, crop production estimates, and other relevant factors.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for machine learning models.
3. **Model Development**: Build multiple machine learning models, including ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet, to capture different patterns influencing price movements.
4. **Hybrid Model Integration**: Combine the strengths of ARIMA with LSTM and Prophet to create hybrid models for improved accuracy.
5. **Supply Chain Visualization**: Implement real-time visualization of the supply chain to identify bottlenecks and provide insights.
6. **AI-Powered Chatbot Integration**: Develop and deploy AI-powered chatbots for user interaction and data queries.
7. **Decision Support System**: Integrate a system that recommends the optimal times for releasing buffer stocks and provides real-time alerts to reduce market volatility.
8. **User Dashboard**: Create a user-friendly dashboard that displays forecasts, insights, and alerts to assist decision-makers.
9. **Deployment and Continuous Monitoring**: Deploy the system and continuously monitor its performance, updating models and data as needed.

## How It Works


The system leverages a hybrid machine learning approach to capture both short-term and long-term price changes, accounting for linear trends and complex, non-linear patterns. By providing real-time supply chain visualization, AI-powered chatbots, and decision support, the platform ensures timely interventions to stabilize prices effectively.

## Conclusion

This multi-model approach offers a robust solution to the challenges of maintaining food price stability in India, equipping stakeholders with the necessary tools and insights to make informed decisions and reduce market volatility.
